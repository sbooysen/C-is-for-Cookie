## Dataset Used
We will be using Girl Scout Cookie Sales Data from 2019-2022.

[US Census for Household Income](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=median%20income&g=0500000US37119%248600000&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S1903 "US Census for Household Income")

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Postgress will be used to clean and merge the data. Excel will be used to organize and sort the data. Pandas will be used to visualize the data as well as manipulate and analyze the data.

## Database Storage
Postgress will be used for housing our database while we store our data in GitHub.

## Machine Learning
Supervised learning with Logistic Regression.

## Dashboard
Along with our Tableau graphs, weâ€™ll be using D3 and Leaflet to display our data on an interactive map. It will be hosted in a PowerPoint.

## What's the deal?
Our goal is to analyze the Girl Scout cookie data to compare and predict sales in high-income vs. low-income areas. Our data encompasses information from 2019-2022, allowing us to see before, during, and after COVID results. Along with the sales analysis, we'll be analyzing the in-person vs online order data to see if we can predict how the majority of the orders will occur next year.

Our project will be focused on the bellow questions:
How good/bad were sales in high-income areas(Pre-COVID to Mid-COVID to Post-COVID)?
How good/bad were sales in mid-income areas(Pre-COVID to Mid-COVID to Post-COVID)?
How good/bad were sales in low-income areas(Pre-COVID to Mid-COVID to Post-COVID)?

We will also be looking over the popularity of certain cookies in the various zips/areas that we are analyzing.
